Given a time series of photon arrivals, $\{ t_i \}$, we want to
estimate a state $s_i$ for each photon, reflecting the origin of the
photon (e.g. background $A$ or burst $B$). We note that bursts can be
said to have a characteristic distribution of lengths, described by an
auto-correlation $G(\tau) = ...$

We assume that the state $\{s_i\}$ constitutes a Markov chain with
finite memory. Moreover, we assume that photons originate from one of
two homogenous Poisson processes, $A$ or $B$. 

To capture the correlation between temporally local states, we introduce a factor $\phi_{s_i}$,
\[ \phi_{s_i}(s_i=B \vert s_0 ... s_i, t_0 ... t_i) = \prod_j G(t_i - t_j) P(s_j=B) \]
