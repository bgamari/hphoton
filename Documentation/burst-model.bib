abstract = {We present a method for the analysis of optical single molecule emission data that exhibit discrete intensity jumps. This new method uses a generalized likelihood ratio test that determines the location of an intensity change point based on individual photon arrival times. This test is applied recursively to an entire single molecule intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points. Expectation-maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

abstract = {Single molecule spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have several profound features in common, chief among which is that both follow the dynamics of some degrees of freedom of a single molecule over time. The analysis is essentially the same: one investigates the changes in the degrees of freedom followed. For instance, in a single molecule fluorescence experiment, the degree of freedom is often the number of photons detected in some time period. In this article, we introduce a straightforward Bayesian method for detecting if and when changes occurred. In contrast to methods based upon maximum likelihood estimates, a Bayesian approach allows for a more systematic means not only to change point detection but also to cluster the data into states. Most importantly, the Bayesian method supplies a simpler hypothesis testing framework. Although we focus on Poisson-distributed data, the Bayesian methods outlined here can in principle be applied to data sampled from any distribution.},
